# Identifying Road Defects through Object Detection

This repo aims to demonstrate the application of transfer learning for road defect detection. 

Data and annotations for model training was contributed by [sekilab](https://github.com/sekilab/RoadDamageDetector/blob/master/RoadDamageDatasetTutorial.ipynb)

While other open datasets were available, the data collected by sekilab across 7 municipalities in Japan on a smartphone was selected due to the ease of implementation, and applicability in other contexts. 

## A model was trained on SSD MobileNet
- Training a Road Defect Detector_v0.1.ipynb
- SSD MobileNet was selected for its detection speed and accuracy, an important consideration should the model be deployed for realtime detection of road defects
