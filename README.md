# Identifying Road Defects through Object Detection

This repo aims to demonstrate the application of transfer learning for road defect detection. 

Data and annotations for model training was contributed by [sekilab](https://github.com/sekilab/RoadDamageDetector/blob/master/RoadDamageDatasetTutorial.ipynb)

While other open datasets were available, the data collected by sekilab across 7 municipalities in Japan on a smartphone was selected due to the ease of implementation, and applicability in other contexts. 

## A model was trained on SSD MobileNet
- Training a Road Defect Detector_v0.1.ipynb
- SSD MobileNet was selected for its detection speed and accuracy, an important consideration should the model be deployed for realtime detection of road defects

Monitoring Performance on Tensorboard:

## Model Evaluation
- TestRoadDamageDatasetTutorial.ipynb

The performance of the model was also measured on images extracted from Google Images

### Unable to detect some images, possibly due to low light/ angle of image

## Future Work
- The model may be improved through augmentation and increasing the runtime
- Additional data and annotation may be collected to more accurately reflect local road conditions and characteristics
- Annotation can be done using LabelImg (https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg)
- The example below is an image captured on an in car camera, depicting a car approaching an alligator crack. LabelImg can be used to annotate the image
